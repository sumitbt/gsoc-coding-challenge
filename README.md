# gsoc-coding-challenge

Code Challenge: Write a single jupyter notebook that requests data from the enviroCar REST API and visualizes the data on a map and within graphs. Perform various analyses based on single and multiple tracks that make sense to you. You are free to use any python package you like. Try to exemplify in your notebook on how you want to deal with the enviroCar data during GSoC. Make first attempts on how you want to structure the final python package. Add markdown describing your ideas in more detail.
